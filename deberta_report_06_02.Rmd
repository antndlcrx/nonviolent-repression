# Project Summary: ACLED Data Automatic Labelling

## Introduction
This document outlines the methodology and results of a project aimed at training a classifier for the automatic labelling of Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) using hand-labelled observations.

## Model Selection
- The model chosen for this task was **DeBERTa Base**.
- No experiments were conducted with other Language Models (LMs) or different sized versions of DeBERTa.

## Dataset and Training
- The initial dataset comprised **4,405 observations**, which were split into training, validation, and test sets with **2,643**, **881**, and **881** observations respectively.
- The classifier was fine-tuned using the following hyperparameters:
  - Warm-up steps: **500**
  - Batch size: **8**
  - Weight decay: **0.01**
  - Learning rate: **1e-4** (to be confirmed by Maksim)
- The choice of batch size was influenced by cost constraints, allowing the training to run on a default Google Colab setup. Other parameters were selected based on default settings, and no hyperparameter tuning was conducted.

## Performance Metrics
The classifier's performance on the test set is summarized as follows:

| Label           | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|-----------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Cultural        | 87%       | 100%   | 93%      |
| Economic        | 84%       | 89%    | 86%      |
| Environmental   | 90%       | 91%    | 91%      |
| Legal           | 93%       | 93%    | 93%      |
| Political       | 99%       | 95%    | 97%      |
| Social          | 88%       | 91%    | 89%      |
| War (anti)      | 97%       | 97%    | 97%      |
| War (pro)       | 99%       | 100%   | 99%      |

### Overall Performance
- **Micro Average**:
  - Precision: 95%
  - Recall: 95%
  - F1 Score: 95%

- **Macro Average**:
  - Precision: 92%
  - Recall: 95%
  - F1 Score: 93%

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates effective use of the DeBERTa Base model for the automatic classification of ACLED data, with significant precision and recall across a range of labels.
