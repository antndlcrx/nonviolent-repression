Protest News Counts from Four media sources

We use keywords to find protest related stories among all news articles from four media sources. 

	data description and parsing issues: 
	- kprf 55 duplicates - most are na's (parsing is fine)
	- kommersant 9218 duplicates - some na's and other scraping or parsing mistakes
	- activatica 13 duplicates but weird things happening in main datafile: #экопротест2209: a lot of almost duplicate texts 
	- kavkaz appears to have a lot parsing issues (potentially due to \" pattern used before every quotation mark in the text). The 	issue causes text content to partially appear in "tags" column. 

1. To establish the keywords, we use word embeddings to find most similar nouns to the word "protest" using gensim library in python
2. then, in R, we use quanteda library to tokenise the corpus and find documents which mention either of protest keywords found in step 1. 
	we further do initial descriptive stats in R to see prevalence of keywords in the corpus 

3. We rely on quanteda's newsmap to locate protests happening in Russia
